Once, the birds decided they wanted a master and chose one of their own to be their king.
All the birds were called for a meeting, and even though some from faraway lands couldn't attend, many still came from distant meadows and woods.
The eagle, who considered himself the king already, arrived late in style.
The hawk, a potential surprise contender for the throne, was the most enthusiastic about the meeting.
Even the least likely candidates for becoming the king, such as the small fry, robin, bluebird, owl, lark, and sparrow, attended the meeting.
Despite the annoyance caused by its call, the cuckoo was also invited and attended the meeting.
The unnamed tiny bird ended up changing the power dynamic among the birds.
With so many birds gathering, it was expected that there would be chaos and noise at the meeting.
There were various sounds like piping, hissing, and clacking, but eventually, they agreed that the bird that could fly the highest would become the king.
Initially, the tiny bird stayed close to the eagle without drawing attention, but right before the competition started, it jumped on the eagle's back unnoticed.
All the birds flew into the air in a great flock when the signal was given.
A black cloud of dust filled the air above the field.
The chirping and flapping of birds could be heard from fields several miles away.
The tired little birds quickly fell back to earth.
It was unsurprising that the larger birds lasted longer and flew higher, but the eagle flew the highest.
Could the eagle, which appeared to be flying directly towards the sun, be stopped?
The other birds became exhausted and dropped out of the race one by one. When the eagle noticed this, it questioned the purpose of flying higher.
I have won and I am victorious.
The birds below all called out together, "Come back, come back!"
You must be our king since no one can fly as high as you.
A shrill voice cried out, and suddenly, the little bird without a name flew out of the eagle's feathers where it had been hidden. Only I did not cry out.
He laughed to himself, having easily outwitted the other birds with his guile, which was his ace up his sleeve.
He soared higher and higher until he disappeared from view, then folded his wings and descended to the ground while shouting loudly, 'I am king! I am king!'
The eagle didn't know the little bird was hiding in its feathers, so it was surprised when the bird suddenly flew out.
The birds on earth were all upset.
The birds were angry and shouting that you, not the eagle, are their king.
You broke all the rules to achieve this, so we don't want someone who is just clever and sly to be our ruler.
The unnamed bird suggested that everyone should start fresh and take on a new, challenging task.
After completing the task, we can decide who should be the true king.
