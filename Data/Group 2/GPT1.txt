The birds decided they wanted a leader and one of them should be king.
All the birds were called to a meeting, and even though some from distant lands couldn't come, many still came from faraway meadows and woods.
The eagle, who believed he was already the king, arrived late in style.
The hawk was very excited about the meeting because he was a potential candidate for the king.
Even the small and unlikely contenders for the position of king, such as the robin, bluebird, owl, lark, and sparrow, attended the meeting.
The cuckoo, who was almost excluded due to his irritating call, still attended the meeting.
The unnamed little bird ended up changing the power dynamic among the birds.
The large number of birds gathered made it expected that there would be chaos and noise at the meeting.
Amidst chirping, hissing, and clacking, the birds finally agreed to choose the one who could fly the highest as their king.
Initially, the small bird stayed close to the eagle but went unnoticed when it hopped onto the eagle's back just before the competition began.
When the signal was given, all the birds flew up together in a big group.
The field was covered by a black cloud-like dust.
Birds could be heard chirping and flapping their wings from fields located miles away.
The little birds fell back quickly to earth when they grew tired.
It was not surprising that the larger birds flew higher and lasted longer, but the eagle flew the highest.
Could the eagle, flying straight into the sun, be stopped by anyone?
One by one, the other birds became exhausted and when the eagle noticed, he questioned the point of continuing to fly higher.
I have won and am victorious.
The birds below called out in unison to return.
You must be our king because no one can fly as high as you.
A sharp voice cried out, "Except me!" and the nameless little bird rose from where he had been hiding in the eagle's feathers.
He laughed to himself, having easily outwitted the other birds with his cleverness.
He flew higher and higher until he disappeared from sight, then he folded his wings and descended to the ground, shouting loudly 'I am king! I am king!'
The eagle didn't notice the bird hiding in its feathers, so it was surprised when the bird suddenly flew out.
The birds on the ground were all in a state of agitation.
The birds cried out angrily, saying that you, not the eagle, were their king.
By breaking all the rules, you've shown that you're only tricky and cunning, and so we won't allow you to rule over us.
The unnamed bird suggested starting fresh and undertaking a new challenging task.
After completing the task, we can determine the true king.
