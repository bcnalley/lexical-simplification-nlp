The birds wanted a leader, so they decided to choose one of their own as king.
All the birds were called to a meeting, and although some from distant lands couldn't come, many still came from faraway meadows and woods.
The eagle, who considered himself the king, arrived late in style.
The hawk, the underdog for king, was extremely excited for the meeting.
The small and unlikely candidates for the king, including the robin, bluebird, owl, lark, and sparrow, attended the meeting.
Despite annoying the other birds with its call, the cuckoo was also present at the meeting, though almost not invited.
The unnamed tiny bird ended up changing the power dynamics among the birds.
With so many birds in attendance, it was expected that there would be a lot of confusion and noise during the meeting.
There were various sounds like piping, hissing, and clacking, but eventually, the birds agreed to make the one who could fly the highest as the king.
Initially, the tiny bird stayed close to the eagle but went unnoticed as it hopped on the eagle's back just before the competition began.
The birds flew into the air in a great flock when the signal was given.
A cloud of dust filled the air and it appeared dark over the field.
Birds could be heard chirping and flapping their wings from fields located miles away.
The little birds quickly fell back to earth when they grew tired.
It was not surprising that the larger birds flew higher and lasted longer, but the eagle flew the highest.
Could someone halt the eagle's flight towards the sun?
One by one, the other birds became exhausted, and when the eagle noticed, he wondered, "What's the point of flying higher?"
I have won and I am the king.
The birds below called out together, saying "Come back, come back."
You must be our king because no one can fly as high as you.
A shrill voice cried out, and unexpectedly, a nameless little bird rose from where it had been hiding in the feathers on the eagle's back.
He laughed to himself, having easily outwitted the other birds with his guile, his ace up his sleeve.
He soared higher and higher until he disappeared from sight, then folded his wings and descended to the earth, crying out loudly 'I am king! I am king!'
The eagle was unaware of the little bird hiding in his feathers and was surprised when the bird suddenly flew out.
The birds on earth were all upset.
The birds were angry and declared "You, not the eagle, are our king!"
You broke all the rules, so we don't want someone who's just tricky and cunning to be our king.
The unnamed bird suggested starting fresh and undertaking a new challenging task.
After completing the challenge, we can decide who should be the true king.
