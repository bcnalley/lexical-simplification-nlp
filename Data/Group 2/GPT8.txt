The birds wanted a leader and decided to choose one of their own as king.
All the birds were called to a meeting, and even though some from faraway lands couldn't come, many birds traveled from distant meadows and woods to attend.
The eagle, who considered himself the king, arrived late in style.
The hawk was thrilled about the meeting because he was a surprise candidate for king.
Even the small and unlikely candidates for becoming king, including the robin, bluebird, owl, lark, and sparrow, attended the meeting.
Despite almost not being invited due to his annoying call, the cuckoo attended the meeting.
The unnamed tiny bird ended up changing the power dynamics among the birds.
It was expected that there would be chaos and noise at the meeting, considering the large number of birds gathered.
Amidst chirping, hissing, and clacking, it was eventually agreed that the bird capable of flying the highest would become the king.
Initially, the small bird stayed close to the eagle but went unnoticed by it. As the competition was about to begin, the small bird quietly hopped onto the eagle's back.
When the signal was given, all the birds flew into the air in a great flock.
A cloud of dust filled the air above the field, appearing like a black cloud.
The chirping and flapping of birds could be heard from fields several miles away.
The tired little birds quickly fell back to earth.
It was unsurprising that the larger birds lasted longer and flew higher, but the eagle flying the highest was also expected.
Could the eagle, flying directly into the sun, be stopped by anyone?
The other birds became exhausted one by one, and upon seeing this, the eagle wondered if there was any point in flying higher.
I've already won this and I am the king.
The birds below all called out at once, saying "come back, come back."
You must be our king since no one can fly as high as you.
A shrill voice cried out, and suddenly the unnamed little bird emerged from where it had been hiding in the eagle's feathers.
He laughed to himself, having easily outwitted the other birds with his cunning.
He mounted higher and higher until he disappeared from sight, then folded his wings and descended to the ground while crying out loudly, 'I am king! I am king!'
The eagle didn't realize the little bird was hiding in his feathers, so he was surprised when the bird suddenly flew out.
The birds on the ground were very upset.
The birds were angry and exclaimed that you, not the eagle, were their king.
You broke all the rules to achieve this, so we don't want someone who is just sneaky and deceitful to be our ruler.
The unnamed bird suggested starting fresh and taking on a new challenge.
After the new challenge, we can determine who should be the true king.
