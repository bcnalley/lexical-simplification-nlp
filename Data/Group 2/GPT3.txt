The birds wanted a master and to choose a king among themselves.
All the birds were invited to a meeting, but some from faraway lands couldn't attend. Still, many birds traveled from distant meadows and woods to attend.
The eagle, who considered himself the king, arrived late, but in style.
The hawk, a potential surprise candidate for king, was the most enthusiastic about the meeting.
The small and unlikely candidates for becoming the king, such as the robin, bluebird, owl, lark, and sparrow, also attended the meeting.
The cuckoo, who almost didn't receive an invitation due to his annoying call, also attended.
The unnamed tiny bird ended up changing the power dynamics among the birds.
With so many birds in attendance, it was expected that there would be a lot of commotion and noise at the meeting.
After much noise and discussion, they decided that the bird capable of flying the highest would become the king.
Initially, the little bird stayed near the eagle, but as the competition was about to begin, it hopped onto the eagle's back unnoticed.
When the signal was given, all the birds flew up into the air together.
The field appeared covered by a black cloud-like mass as the air filled with dust.
Birds chirping and flapping their wings could be heard from fields located miles away.
The tired little birds quickly fell back to earth.
It was unsurprising that the larger birds flew higher and longer, but the eagle flying the highest was expected.
Could someone prevent the eagle, which appeared to be flying directly toward the sun?
One by one, the other birds became exhausted, and upon witnessing this, the eagle questioned the point of flying any higher.
I have won and am the king.
The birds below called out together, urging "Come back, come back!"
You must be our king since no one can fly as high as you.
A high-pitched voice cried out, "Except for me!" Suddenly, the unnamed small bird emerged from the eagle's feathers, where it had been hidden.
He laughed to himself at how easily he had outwitted the other birds, thanks to his guile, his ace up his sleeve.
Mounting higher and higher until he vanished from sight, he then folded his wings and descended to the ground, crying out loudly 'I am king! I am king!'
The eagle didn't realize the small bird was hiding in its feathers, so it was surprised when the bird suddenly flew out.
The birds on the ground were very upset.
The birds cried out in anger, saying "You are our king, not the eagle!"
You broke all the rules, so we don't want someone who is just tricky and cunning like you to be our king.
The unnamed bird suggested that everyone start fresh and take on a new challenging task.
After completing the new challenge, we can determine who should be the true king.
