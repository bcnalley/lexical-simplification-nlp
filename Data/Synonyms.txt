Once upon a time the birds took it into their heads that they would like a ruler and that one of their own must be chosen monarch
A gathering of all the birds was convened and though they realized the birds who were from the farthest lands would be unable to come many birds came from distant fields and forests
The eagle who already thought himself the unofficial king came fashionably late
It was a hawk who was most interested in the meeting because he had an outside chance to be leader
The smallest came too and the robin the bluebird the owl the lark and the sparrow who had the smallest chance to be leader all came to the gathering
The cuckoo who was almost not welcome because his voice so upset the other birds also was there
It was the very little bird without a name however that would end up changing the balance of power among the birds
That there would be a lot of confusion and ruckus among the birds at the gathering was not suprising with how many birds that were there
There was piping hissing and clacking but at last it was decided that the bird who could rise the farthest would be leader
The small bird laid down close to the eagle at the beginning but the eagle did not see the bird jumping onto his back right as the contest was about to start
Into the sky in a great group all the birds rose when the alarm was given
The sky was full of dirt and it looked as if a dark cloud was hovering above the meadow
You could hear the birds chirping and flapping from yards that were miles away.
The small birds that quickly were exhausted descended back rapidly to ground
The fact that the bigger ones lasted longer and rose farther and farther but the eagle rose farthest of all shocked no one
Would anyone prevent the eagle that looked to be rising directly into the sun
The rest of the birds retired one by one and when the eagle observed that he thought what is the point of rising any further
This triumph is in the bag and I am ruler
Then the birds underneath yelled with one voice return return
It is you who should be our ruler since no one can rise as far as you
Except me yelled a high high voice and out of nowhere the small bird without a name stood from the eagle's back where he had reclined concealed in the feathers
His sneakiness was the ace up his sleeve and he chuckled to himself at how simple it had been to outsmart the other birds
Farther and farther he rose until he was invisible and then bending his wings together he dropped to ground yelling highly I am ruler I am ruler
The eagle misled by the small bird had not noticed the bird in his feathers and so had not at all foreseen the bird to come flying out like that
The birds on ground were all up in arms
You and not the eagle our ruler the birds yelled stewing with anger
You have done this by destroying every law in the book so we will not have you who are only sneaky and conniving to rule over us
The bird with no name then thought to clear the air and stated then let all begin with a fresh slate and undertake a new difficult challenge
Then all can decide who will be the true ruler
