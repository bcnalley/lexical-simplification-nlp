The birds wanted a master and decided to choose one of their own as king.
All the birds were called to a meeting, and even though some from faraway lands couldn't come, many still came from distant meadows and woods.
The eagle, who considered himself the king, came late to the meeting.
The hawk was very enthusiastic about the meeting because he was a potential candidate for king.
The small and unlikely candidates, including the robin, bluebird, owl, lark, and sparrow, attended the meeting.
Despite his annoying call, the cuckoo was invited and attended the meeting.
The unnamed tiny bird ended up changing the power dynamics among the birds.
Given the large number of birds gathered, it was expected that there would be a lot of noise and confusion during the meeting.
There were various sounds like piping, hissing, and clacking, but ultimately, they decided that the bird capable of flying the highest would be the king.
Initially, the little bird stayed close to the eagle without being noticed, and just as the competition was about to start, it sneaked onto the eagle's back.
The birds flew into the air in a great flock when the signal was given.
The field was covered in a cloud of dust, making it look like a black cloud was hovering in the air.
Birds chirping and flapping could be heard from fields several miles away.
The tired little birds quickly fell back to earth.
No one was surprised that the eagle flew the highest, even though the larger birds held out longer and flew higher.
Could anyone prevent the eagle from flying directly into the sun?
As the other birds tired and dropped out one by one, the eagle realized there was no point in flying higher.
I have won this victory and am the king.
The birds below called out together, "Come back, come back!"
You must be our king because no one can fly as high as you.
A shrill voice cried out, and suddenly a nameless bird flew out from the feathers on the eagle's back.
He laughed to himself at how easy it had been to outwit the other birds, thanks to his guile, which was his ace up his sleeve.
He soared higher and higher until he disappeared from view, then folded his wings and plummeted to the ground while crying out in a shrill voice, 'I am king! I am king!'
The eagle didn't feel the little bird hiding in its feathers, so it was surprised when the bird suddenly flew out.
The birds on earth were all agitated.
The birds cried out, angry and saying "You, not the eagle, are our king."
You broke all the rules to achieve this, and we won't let someone who is merely sly and deceptive rule over us.
The unnamed bird suggested that everyone should start fresh and take on a new challenging task.
After completing the challenge, we can decide who should be the true king.
