Once, the birds decided they wanted a master and picked one of their own to be their king.
All the birds were invited to a meeting, but some couldn't attend because they were from faraway lands. Nonetheless, many birds came from distant meadows and woods.
The eagle, considering himself the king, came late in style.
The hawk was very excited about the meeting because he was a surprise candidate for becoming the king.
Even the underdogs like the robin, bluebird, owl, lark, and sparrow, who had little chance of becoming the king, attended the meeting.
Despite annoying the other birds with its call, the cuckoo managed to attend the meeting.
The unnamed tiny bird ended up changing the power dynamics among the birds.
With a large number of birds attending the meeting, it was expected to be noisy and chaotic.
Amidst various sounds like chirping, hissing, and clacking, the birds decided to choose the one who could fly the highest as their king.
Initially, the small bird stayed close to the eagle, but when the competition was about to start, it went unnoticed as it hopped onto the eagle's back.
When the signal was given, all the birds flew up in a large group.
A cloud of dust filled the air, making it appear as though a black cloud was hovering over the field.
Birds chirping and flapping could be heard from fields miles away.
The small birds, exhausted, quickly fell back to the ground.
It was not surprising that the larger birds lasted longer and flew higher, but the eagle's ability to fly the highest was expected.
Could anyone prevent the eagle from flying directly into the sun?
One by one, the other birds grew tired and stopped flying. When the eagle noticed this, he wondered what was the point of flying higher.
I have won and am now the king.
The birds below all called out together, "Come back, come back!"
You must be our king because nobody can fly as high as you.
A shrill voice cried, and the little bird without a name rose from the eagle's back where it had been hidden in the feathers, leaving only me.
He laughed to himself, having easily outwitted the other birds with his guile, which was his ace up his sleeve.
He flew up high, disappeared from view, then folded his wings and descended to the ground, loudly proclaiming "I am king, I am king!"
The eagle didn't know the little bird was hiding in its feathers, so it was surprised when the bird suddenly flew out.
The birds on the ground were all upset.
The birds cried out in anger, saying that you, not the eagle, should be our king.
You broke every rule in the book, so we don't want someone as tricky and cunning as you to be our king.
The unnamed bird suggested starting fresh and taking on a new challenge.
After completing the task, we can decide who deserves to be the true king.
