The birds wanted a master and decided to choose one of their own as their king.
All the birds were summoned to a meeting, but some couldn't attend because they were too far away. Despite this, many birds traveled from distant meadows and woods to attend.
The eagle, who considered himself the king already, arrived late in style.
The hawk was thrilled about the meeting as he was the unexpected contender for the throne.
The small and unlikely birds, including the robin, bluebird, owl, lark, and sparrow, attended the meeting.
Although the other birds were annoyed by the cuckoo's call, he still managed to get invited and attended the meeting.
The unnamed tiny bird ended up changing the power dynamic among the birds.
Given the large number of birds present, it was expected that there would be a lot of commotion and noise during the meeting.
There were various sounds like piping, hissing, and clacking, but eventually, they agreed to make the bird that could fly the highest as the king.
Initially, the small bird stayed close to the eagle but went unnoticed as it jumped on the eagle's back just before the competition began.
The birds flew into the air in a great flock when the signal was given.
A cloud of black dust appeared to be hovering over the field.
The sound of birds chirping and flapping could be heard from fields located miles away.
The small birds tired and quickly fell back to earth.
It was unsurprising that the larger birds lasted longer, flew higher, and the eagle flew the highest.
Could someone prevent the eagle from flying straight into the sun?
As the other birds tired and dropped out one by one, the eagle wondered why bother flying any higher.
I have won and I am the king.
The birds below all called out together, saying "Come back, come back!"
You must be our king since no one can fly as high as you.
A shrill voice cried, and the little nameless bird emerged suddenly from the eagle's feathers where it had been hidden.
He laughed to himself, having easily outwitted the other birds with his guile, his ace up his sleeve.
He mounted higher and higher until he disappeared from sight, then folded his wings and descended to the ground while crying out shrilly 'I am king, I am king!'
The eagle didn't notice the small bird hiding in his feathers, so he was surprised when the bird suddenly flew out.
The birds on earth were upset or agitated.
The birds were angry and exclaimed that you, not the eagle, were their king.
You broke every rule to achieve this, so we won't allow someone who's just tricky and cunning to rule over us.
The bird without a name suggested starting fresh and doing a new challenging task to clear things up.
After completing the new challenge, we can determine who should be the true king.
