The birds decided they wanted a leader and that one of them should be king.
All the birds were called to a meeting, but some couldn't come because they were from far away. Nonetheless, many birds came from far meadows and woods.
The eagle, who considered himself the king, arrived late, trying to make an entrance.
The hawk was thrilled about the meeting as he was a surprise candidate for the king.
The small and unlikely candidates, including the robin, bluebird, owl, lark, and sparrow, attended the meeting.
Despite the annoyance his call caused the other birds, the cuckoo was still invited and attended the meeting.
The unnamed tiny bird ended up changing the power dynamics among the birds.
It was expected that the meeting would be noisy and chaotic due to the large number of birds present.
Amidst the sounds of chirping, hissing, and clacking, the birds agreed to make the one who could fly the highest their king.
Initially, the small bird stayed close to the eagle, but as the competition began, the eagle remained unaware of the tiny bird hopping onto his back.
When the signal was given, all the birds flew up into the air together.
A black cloud of dust appeared to be hovering over the field.
The chirping and flapping of birds from fields miles away were audible.
The little birds fell quickly back to earth when they grew tired.
It was not surprising that the larger birds lasted longer, flew higher and higher, but the eagle flew the highest.
Was it possible to stop the eagle flying towards the sun?
The other birds gradually gave up, and when the eagle noticed, he wondered, "What's the point of flying higher?"
I have won and I am the king.
The birds below called out together, "Come back, come back!"
You must be our king because nobody can fly as high as you.
Suddenly, a high-pitched voice cried out, "Except me!" and the small, unnamed bird that had been hiding in the eagle's feathers flew out.
He laughed to himself at how easily he had outwitted the other birds, thanks to his guile, his secret weapon.
He soared higher and higher until he disappeared from view, then folded his wings and descended to the ground while crying out loudly, 'I am king! I am king!'
The eagle didn't realize the little bird was hiding in its feathers, so it was surprised when the bird suddenly flew out.
The birds on the ground were very upset.
The birds cried out angrily, saying "You, not the eagle, are our king!"
You broke all the rules, so the birds think you are too tricky and deceitful to be their king.
The unnamed bird suggested starting fresh and taking on a new, challenging task.
After completing the challenge, we can decide who should be the king.
