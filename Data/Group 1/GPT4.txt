The birds decided they wanted a leader, so they chose one of their own to be king.
All the birds were invited to a meeting, but some couldn't attend because they were from faraway lands. Nonetheless, many birds came from distant meadows and woods.
The eagle, who considered himself the king already, arrived late.
The hawk, a potential surprise candidate for the kingship, was the most enthusiastic about the meeting.
The small and unlikely candidates, including the robin, bluebird, owl, lark, and sparrow, attended the meeting.
Despite annoying the other birds with its call, the cuckoo was still invited and attended the meeting.
It was the unnamed tiny bird that ultimately changed the power dynamics among the birds.
With so many birds gathering, it was expected that there would be chaos and noise at the meeting.
Amidst chirping, hissing, and clacking, they concluded that the bird capable of flying the highest would be crowned as the king.
Initially, the little bird stayed close to the eagle, but just before the competition started, it sneaked onto the eagle's back unnoticed.
The birds flew into the air in a great flock when the signal was given.
A cloud of black dust was hovering over the field.
Birds chirping and flapping could be heard from fields several miles away.
The tired little birds quickly fell back to earth.
It was unsurprising that the bigger birds lasted longer, flew higher, and the eagle flew the highest.
Could the eagle, which appeared to be flying directly towards the sun, be stopped by anyone?
One by one, the other birds became exhausted. When the eagle noticed this, he questioned the purpose of flying any higher.
I have already won this victory and I am the ruler.
The birds below all called out together, saying "come back, come back".
You must be our king because no one else can fly as high as you.
A high-pitched voice cried out, and suddenly, the unnamed bird that had been hiding in the eagle's feathers took flight.
He laughed to himself, having easily outwitted the other birds with his cunning.
He flew higher and higher until he disappeared from sight, then folded his wings and descended to the ground, crying out loudly 'I am king, I am king!'
The eagle didn't realize the small bird was hiding in its feathers, so it was surprised when the bird suddenly flew out.
The birds on the ground were all upset.
The birds were furious and shouted that you, not the eagle, were their king.
You broke every rule to achieve this, so we don't want someone who is only clever and deceitful to be our ruler.
The unnamed bird suggested that everyone start fresh and take on a new, challenging task.
After completing the new challenge, we can decide who should be the true king.
