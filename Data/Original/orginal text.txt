Once upon a time the birds took it into their heads that they would like a master and that one of their number must be chosen king
A meeting of all the birds was called and though they understood the birds who were from the most distant lands would be unable to come many birds came from far away meadows and woods
The eagle who already thought himself the de facto king arrived fashionably late
It was a hawk who was most excited about the meeting because he was the dark horse for king
The small fry came too and the robin the bluebird the owl the lark and the sparrow who had only a chance in a million to be king were all present at the meeting
The cuckoo who was almost not invited because his call so annoyed the other birds came too
It was the very little bird who had no name at all however that would end up overturning the balance of power among the birds
That there would be great confusion and noise among the birds at the meeting was to be expected given the sheer numbers of birds that have gathered
There was piping hissing and clacking but finally it was decided that the bird that could fly the highest should be king
The little bird laid low near the eagle at first but the eagle did not notice the bird hopping onto his back right as the competition was about to commence
Into the air in a great flock all the birds flew when the signal was given
The air was full of dust and it seemed as if a black cloud were floating over the field
You could hear the birds chirping and flapping from fields that were miles away
The little birds that soon grew tired fell back quickly to earth
The fact that the larger ones held out longer and flew higher and higher but the eagle flew highest of any surprised no one
Could anyone stop the eagle that seemed to be flying straight into the sun
The other birds gave out one by one and when the eagle saw this he thought What is the use of flying any higher
This victory is in the bag and I am king
Then the birds below called with one accord Come back come back
It is you who must be our king because no one can fly as high as you
Except me cried a shrill shrill voice and out of the blue the little bird without a name rose from the eagle's back where he had lain hidden in the feathers
His guile was the ace up his sleeve and he laughed to himself at how easy it had been to outwit the other birds
Higher and higher he mounted until he was lost to sight and then folding his wings together he sank to earth crying shrilly I am king I am king
The eagle tricked by the little bird had not sensed the bird in his feathers and so had not at all expected the bird to come flying out like that
The birds back on earth were all up in arms
You and not the eagle our king the birds cried fuming with anger
You have done this by breaking every rule in the book so we will not have you who are simply tricky and cunning to reign over us
The bird without a name then decided to clear the air and said Then let everyone start with a clean slate and perform a new challenging task
Then we can decide who should be the real king
